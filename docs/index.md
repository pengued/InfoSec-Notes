While pentesting we are always looking from the Red Team perspective. 
How can we infiltrate inside?, Which services can cause a take over?, Can i exploit this? ...

And there are always lots of options for both Windows and Linux and for their services. Then one of my friends asked me, You are talking about this service is exploitable, this OS is exploitable this way. Then how should i protect it?
I realized there is lack of complete checklist in my hand from the Blue Team Perspective. So i decided to write one, for further reference.
